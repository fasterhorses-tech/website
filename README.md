## Notes

- installed default nextjs project with `npx create-next-app@latest my-project --eslint`
- confirmed usage of tailwindcss
- ran successfully using `npm run dev`
- added manual i18n setup with page based routing
- added shadcn/ui components using `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
- (was confused here as to the new files and folders created, specifically the lib folder)
- added next-remote-watch to watch for changes in the content and i18n folders

## Dev

- use `npm run dev` to start the dev server

## Structure

- app contains pages and styles, the structure follows the page structure
- components contains reusable components
- i18n contains the translations
- content contains blog posts and the like
- shadcn/ui added lib folder (unclear why?)

## Status Quo

- added i18n support
- created hero section w/o graphics so far
- missing a nice design element
- do we use the orange-600 color as accent?
- reduced legal shit into one page
- next:
  - find / try out recurring design elements that work (squares? shapes?)
  - see if the font is working out, maybe change? do we want a more "architecture" look?
  - add more sections to the home page
  - check out the structure of the browser company - shall we add a prominent value section?
  - is the messaging to cringe? (beautiful and love)
  - do content in a "what cause creates this effect" manner? reduce reduce reduce
  - for that matter, add a this is your challenge, this is our solution section, protentially with different challenges - classify yourself or w/e
  - emphasize "intelligent" and cutting edge to the core! we are new, we are young, we are close to the science, we are close to the future!
  - get more feedback - mito? christian? tektit? truenode? zuzanna?
  - fix alignment of footer link texts (low prio)
  - add legal information (low prio)
- longer term:
  - add fathom analytics (?) & copy the cookie disclaimer from them
  - copy over my blog posts / create new ones (?)
