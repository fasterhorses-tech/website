## Notes

- installed default nextjs project with `npx create-next-app@latest my-project --eslint`
- confirmed usage of tailwindcss
- ran successfully using `npm run dev`
- added manual i18n setup with page based routing
- added shadcn/ui components using `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
- (was confused here as to the new files and folders created, specifically the lib folder)
- added next-remote-watch to watch for changes in the content and i18n folders

## Structure

- app contains pages and styles, the structure follows the page structure
- components contains reusable components
- i18n contains the translations
- content contains blog posts and the like
- shadcn/ui added lib folder (unclear why?)
